# Sorting Algorithm Visualization Module

Used Pygame in Python to create an interactive module that shows how common sorting algorithms sort data, including insertion sort, bubble sort, merge sort, and quick sort. The biggest challenge in this project was getting the module to show each step of the sorting for recursive algorithms like merge sort and quick sort.
